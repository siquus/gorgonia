// Value represents a value that Gorgonia accepts. At this point it is implemented by:
//		- all scalar value types (F64, F32... etc)
// 		- *tensor.Dense
// 		- *dualValue
//
// A Value is essentially any thing that knows its own type and shape.
// Most importantly though, a Value is a pointer - and can be converted into a tensor.Memory.
// This is done for the sake of interoperability with external devices like cgo or CUDA or OpenCL.
// This also means for the most part most Values will be allocated on the heap.
// There are some performance tradeoffs made in this decision, but ultimately this is better than having to manually manage blocks of memory
type Value interface {
	Shape() tensor.Shape // Shape  returns the shape of the Value. Scalar values return ScalarShape()
	Size() int           // Size represents the number of elements in the Value. Note that in cases such as a *tensor.Dense, the underlying slice MAY have more elements than the Size() reports. This is correct.
	Data() interface{}   // Data returns the original representation of the Value
	Dtype() tensor.Dtype // Dtype returns the Dtype of the value
